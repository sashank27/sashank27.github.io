title: Astronomical Time Series Analysis
abstract: 6th Semester Mini Project under Dr. Pawan Chakraborty, IIIT Allahabad
---
- Technology Stack â€“ Python: Numpy, Scipy, Astropy, astroML, Tkinter
- The project demonstrates Spectral Analysis and Forecasting performed on Time Series obtained from Astronomical Observations
- The project employs the use of various Periodogram-based techniques like Fourier Transform, Lomb - Scargle Method, to estimate the Power Spectral Density at various frequencies.
- The accurate forecasting of the data was done by estimating the various parameters of an ARIMA model, by the analysis of the Auto-Correlation Function (ACF) and the Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF) of the data.
- The above-mentioned methods were employed on both evenly-sampled data (LIGO) as well as unevenly-sampled data (LINEAR)
