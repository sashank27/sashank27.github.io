- Technology Stack â€“ Django, Solidity, Metamask, Javascript
- Developed in 36 hours at Hack36, MNNIT Allahabad
- The project aims to automate the process of the compensation provided to the passengers when flights are delayed/canceled, by leveraging the power of smart contracts. 
- As soon as the tracking system sends the details of the flights cancelled, the contract gets triggered and issues the meal, hotel or taxi vouchers to all the passengers of that flight.
- The Airlines can use the developed API to drive the passenger experience.
