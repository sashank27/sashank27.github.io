title: Machine Learning-based Optical Fine Alignment Tool
abstract:  R&D Project under Dr. Sreejith Padinhatteri, Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune.

- The project aims to predict the exact component of the optical system having the misalignment, and is proposed to be used in the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) of the Aditya-L1 mission of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).
- The project consists of two components: Generation of Dataset and Application of various Machine Learning algorithms.
- The datasets consist of various Spot Diagrams, at all possible perturbations under the optical and mechanical tolerances defined previously, created using ZOS-API for Python.
- The optical diagram of the system has been previously created using the Zemax OpticStudio, and used as a base to generate various perturbations using the API.
- The dataset created, would then be fed on to a Machine Learning algorithm, which is yet to be analyzed.
