I'm an undergraduate student in Information Technology at <a href="http://www.iiita.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad</a>. I'm motivated towards <b>Machine Learning</b>, and its application in various domains. I also find myself interested towards <b>Deep Learning</b>, <b>Image Processing</b> and <b>Astronomy</b>.

Apart from academics, I love to read <b>Fiction</b>, listen to <b>Music</b>, and waste my time watching <b>TV Series</b> and spending time alone absolutely thinking nothing... <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i> <i class="far fa-grin-tongue-squint"></i>
